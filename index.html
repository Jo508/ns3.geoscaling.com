Somewhere, somehow, somewhy, something changed. In 493, the Ostrogoths of Croatia should have launched a campaign against Odoacer. Instead, it was launched in 490, unprepared and disorganized. Odoacer won, and in doing so, united all of Croatia under his rule. In 496, Clovis, King of the Franks, had just united all Neustria under his singular rule, and now stood in a position to win all of Gaul. But then, something changed. At the Battle of Vouille, the Visigoths had extra Ostrogothic regiments, refugees from the fall of Croatia, causing the deaths if Clovis and three of his sons, leaving his campaign against the Visigoths in shreds. The remaining son, Chlothar, remained a pagan, but in the process of succession, abolished Salian gavelkind, paving the way for a united Frankish realm. In the south, the Visigoths were consolidating their new dominance, and imposed an uneasy truce, focusing their attentions on the Berbers and Suebi instead, whilst Chlothar campaigned against the Thuringians and Alemanni. Over the next hundred years, the Franks and Goths cooperated against the Burgundians, Berbers, Frisians, and Saxons, resulting in massive gains for both Kingdoms, despite heartfelt sentiments of hatred. The Kingdom of Italy stagnated, and after a combination of botched wars beyond the Danube and Alps, ineffectual rulers, and harsh policy, refugees from the Germanic tribes and Italy settled in Fennoscandia, Transdanubia, and Pomerania. Fennoscandian settlers colonized the southern parts of the region, largely keeping out of Norvegr, home of the Nordic tribes. Two principal kingdoms were formed out of this: Svea Rike and Finnmark. Settlers in Pomerania took a different approach, instead breeding with the Slavs and allowing them to develop with Roman culture. Lastly, settlers in Transdanubia seized the whole of Austria and Bohemia from the Frankish Kingdom, then proceeded to massacre the Avars in Carpathia in one of the first recorded mass genocides. The Transdanubian settlers then promptly divided into realms based around Vienna, Prague, Pest, and Bessarabia. In China, the Three Kingdoms remained, never being united under Sui. Wei completely abandoned everything past the Hangxi Corridor, becoming incarnated into the Min state based around Luoyang and Xian. Shu captured Southern Tibet and Canton, while Wu tried to grab land north of Tian Shan. During this time, India flourished, becoming a great power to be reckoned with. In Indochina, the beginnings of Khmer were taking place, centered around the city of Angkor. In the middle East, Sassanid Persia was fracturing, and Byzantion was slowly losing its grasp over North Africa. Then, Islam exploded. It is perhaps an unfortunate coincidence for India that Khmerâ€™s annexation of modern day Thailand, Malay, Vietnam, and Laos coincided almost exactly with The Caliphate's seizure of territories in Egypt, Mesopotamia, Persia, and Armenia. India was still thriving, blissfully unaware of the impending doom. In 711, the Arabs launched a full-scale invasion of Anatolia, the Levant, and Thrace, and succeeded brilliantly, crumpling the Byzantine Empire. However, in 732, a united Coalition of the Catholic states sought to take back old Byzantine realms. For a brief moment, it looked as if Christendom might unite and the Caliphate would fall. Then came the peace talks, and every dream of unity went to hell. In the end, two Orthodox realms were squeezed out of the Balkans; The Kingdom of Athens and the Kingdom of Abydos, and a Muslim Damascarene realm rebelled against the Caliphate, but the Caliphate was still powerful, and would endure for a little while yet. In 751, the Caliphate took a gamble. They would fight India. To succeed, the Caliphate would have to dislodge a whole religion, but they embarked on their venture all the same. And luckily for India, Khmer and The Three Kingdoms had formed a coalition against India, thereby pressing India in on both sides. The first phase of the War lasted from 751 to 769. This was the offensive venture against India. An uneasy truce then existed between the Caliphate and the Coalition, and in 785, war broke out. In this second phase, Khmer did not participate, setting the stage for Angkor to rise to power. The war ended in 814, and by the time it had finished, Northern India was a barren wasteland. Hundreds of thousands of men were slain on both sides. It's why even centuries later, all of Siberia, Girin, Northern India, Bactria, Sogdiana, and Xinjiang lay abandoned. On the very tip of Southern India, one Kingdom survived in relative obscurity and isolation, taking Muslim beliefs. That was Baluchistan. Over the next two centuries, Persia, North Africa, Egypt, Nubia, the Levant, and Mesopotamia all declared independence from the Caliphate, and so while Islam had spread as far as Sri Lanka, its Central authority was as good as dead. It was in these two centuries, in years of relative peace, 1066 to be exact, that the Caucasian Guard was established, a merchant organization that grew into a military company that eventually grew so powerful, they were unanimously awarded Alania and Armenia. In 1095, the Duchies of Neumark, Pommern, Vasterpruessen, and Osterpruessen deigned to colonize Silesia, Warsaw, Osterpolska, Samogitia, Mazovia, Livonia, and Estonia. In 1099, refugees of the Viennan-Pestian War followed that example, settling Ruthenia and the Pontic Steppe. In 1148, the Ruthenian states came into conflict with hordes who had recently invaded the area. In 1187, the Franks conquer the last Saxons, Angles, Jutes, and Gepids in Denmark. In 1204, the Catholic Church develops the idea of Holy War, and so the Damascarene War begins. It is a full assault by the nations of Christendom against the Arabs to reclaim the Roman Orient, and it fails spectacularly. Almost no lives are lost, but Christians and Muslims exchange knowledge. In 1294, the Teutons in the Frankish Kingdom revolt, starting a chain reaction of wars throughout Europe. It starts with the Noble Von Helsings usurping power in Saxony and declaring that they are the rightful rulers of the German principalities within the Frankish Kingdom. Italy supports the Saxons, Toulouse supports the Franks, and suddenly, Europe is up in flames. Slavs rebel against the Bessarabians, Pest takes the Saxon side, Vienna takes the Frankish side. The Pomeranians, Ruthenians, and Fennoscandians are divided as well. It is the war of the century, and when the English unite Britain (1301) they intervene in the war with yet another claimant, turning what had been a clear war into simple fighting.
